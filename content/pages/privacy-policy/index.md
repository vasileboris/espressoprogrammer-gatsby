## What personal data we collect and why we collect it

### Email address

When visitors subscribe by email for updates on this blog, the email address is saved. Subscriptions can be updated at any time by following *Manage Subscriptions* from received emails.

### Comments

When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitorâ€™s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the [Gravatar][gravatar-service] service to see if you are using it. The [Gravatar][gravatar-service] service privacy policy is available at [Automattic's policy page][automattic-privacy]. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

### Cookies

If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. For more information see [Automattic's cookies policy][automattic-cookies].

## Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

## How long we retain your data

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

## What rights you have over your data

If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request via [email](mailto:boris@espressoprogrammer.com) to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you.

## Where we send your data

Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.
