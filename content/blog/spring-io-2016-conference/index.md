On the 19th and 20th of May this year I was lucky enough to attend the [Spring IO Conference][spring-io-conference] in Barcelona. Why lucky? I was two days away from work in a sunny Spanish city near the Mediterranean Sea. The event is organized by [Sergi Almar][sergi-almar-twitter], a [Spring][spring-io] certified instructor. This is the first time I have attended  this conference so I don't have a reference to compare with. The event was organized [very well][spring-io-agenda], there were no delays and everything ran smoothly. I missed only one thing. I was too lazy to take with me a notebook and I hoped that they'd provide one. Well, I was wrong so I had to look for a place to buy it.

Going to a conference does not make you instantly smarter but if you are curious enough to take notes and after that to look for more information on those topics your effort is rewarded. I'm looking now into my notes and I'm quite shocked how bad I am on taking them. I hope that you'll find some useful information.

It started with an awesome lights show that put us into the right mood for the next two days.

<blockquote class="twitter-video" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/spring_io">@spring_io</a> is starting with an awesome lights spectacle, I&#39;m very impressed <a href="https://t.co/gHXjE7VtG4">pic.twitter.com/gHXjE7VtG4</a></p>&mdash; Alvaro Amor Morales (@aamormo) <a href="https://twitter.com/aamormo/status/733194736878653440">May 19, 2016</a></blockquote>

First day's [keynote][keynote-wiki] speakers were [Juergen Hoeller][juergen-hoeller-springio], [Stéphane Nicoll][stéphane-nicoll-springio] and [Phillip Webb][phillip-webb-springio] and they addressed how they will take us **FROM SPRING FRAMEWORK 4.3 TO 5.0**. I took home with me:

* Support for Spring 3.2 will end by the end of 2016.
* Spring 4.3 will be supported between June 2016 and 2020.
* Spring 5.0 will be released in 2017, close to JDK 9 release but if JDK 9 will be delayed, Spring 5.0 will not wait for it.
* Spring boot 1.4 will have [readable stack traces][spring-boot-1.4-analysis-of-startup-failures] at startup, support to render [ASCII art banners][spring-boot-1.4-image-banners] and many more other features.

The first talk I attended was **CUSTOMIZE YOUR SPRING BOOT EXPERIENCE BY WRITING YOUR OWN SPRING BOOT STARTER** and it was given by [Michael Simons][michael-simons-springio]. My entire experience with Spring Boot is writing the demo for [Memory allocation with Strong, Soft, Weak And Phantom reference types in Java][memory-allocation-strong-soft-weak-phantom-reference-types-java] so I let his [code and slides][michael-simons-springio-code-slides]  speak.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here are the code and the slides for my talk about a kind of magic and custom spring boot starters at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SpringIO16?src=hash">#SpringIO16</a> <a href="https://t.co/sNxBOdmcis">https://t.co/sNxBOdmcis</a></p>&mdash; Michael Simons (@rotnroll666) <a href="https://twitter.com/rotnroll666/status/733239965698625536">May 19, 2016</a></blockquote>

The second talk was delivered by [Julien Dubois][julien-dubois-springio] and it was about **WHAT’S NEW IN JHIPSTER IN 2016**.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Let&#39;s become a bit JHipster at <a href="https://twitter.com/spring_io">@spring_io</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/juliendubois">@juliendubois</a> <a href="https://t.co/GXpXYI3x4W">pic.twitter.com/GXpXYI3x4W</a></p>&mdash; Omikron Inf. &amp; Com. (@omikronic) <a href="https://twitter.com/omikronic/status/733236554395750400">May 19, 2016</a></blockquote>

I couldn't find his slides, so the best way to find more is check directly on [jhipster site][jhipster].

The third talk was one of best where [Oleg Shelajev][oleg-shelajev-springio] discussed about **FLAVORS OF CONCURRENCY IN JAVA**.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SpringIO16?src=hash">#SpringIO16</a>, let&#39;s talk concurrency models on the JVM. That&#39;s a perfect way to spend time after the lunch! <a href="https://t.co/hKI5IBBKy0">https://t.co/hKI5IBBKy0</a></p>&mdash; Oleg Šelajev (@shelajev) <a href="https://twitter.com/shelajev/status/733258848723738624">May 19, 2016</a></blockquote>

I joined a little late and all the seats were taken so I had a great view behind a pillar. [The content][flavors-of-concurrency-in-java-spring-io-16] was great, I have plenty of things to learn about.

Caching is a hot subject, so I joined the talk about **CACHING WITH SPRING: ADVANCED TOPICS AND BEST PRACTICES** by [Michael Plöd][michael-plod-springio].

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That was amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/springio16?src=hash">#springio16</a> Thanks for showing up to my caching talk and for all the kind feedback. Slides: <a href="https://t.co/29SplSvLI7">https://t.co/29SplSvLI7</a></p>&mdash; Michael Plöd (@bitboss) <a href="https://twitter.com/bitboss/status/733309143050813440">May 19, 2016</a></blockquote>

If you want to find more, check his [visual support][michael-plod-springio-slides] for the talk.

This year I played a little bit with [kotlin][kotlinlang] so I wanted to find out more from **DEVELOPING A GEOSPATIAL WEBSERVICE WITH KOTLIN AND SPRING BOOT** talk given by [Sébastien Deleuze][sebastien-deleuze-springio].

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The slides of my <a href="https://twitter.com/springboot">@SpringBoot</a> + <a href="https://twitter.com/kotlin">@Kotlin</a> talk are available at <a href="https://t.co/Wljre3BLzU">https://t.co/Wljre3BLzU</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/springio16?src=hash">#springio16</a></p>&mdash; Sébastien Deleuze (@sdeleuze) <a href="https://twitter.com/sdeleuze/status/733396165299933184">May 19, 2016</a></blockquote>

His [project][geospatial-messenger] was just a pretext to [discuss about kotlin][developing-a-geospatial-webservice-with-spring-boot-and-kotlin].

The last talk of the first day was about **JUNIT 5 – SHAPING THE FUTURE OF TESTING ON THE JVM** and on the stage was [Sam Brannen][sam-brannen-springio].
One of the challenges they need to handle was to run [Junit 5][junit5] in IDEs with no direct support from them. They managed to find an [intermediate solution][junit5-running-tests-ides].

The second day's [keynote][keynote-wiki] speakers were [Rossen Stoyanchev][rossen-stoyanchev-springio] and [Stephane Maldini][stephane-maldini-springio] and they started the day with **DESIGNING APPLICATIONS: THE REACTIVE WAY**.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Entertaining keynote by <a href="https://twitter.com/rstoya05">@rstoya05</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/smaldini">@smaldini</a> on reactive applications at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/springio16?src=hash">#springio16</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/spring5?src=hash">#spring5</a> <a href="https://t.co/Dz5ihd0mqO">pic.twitter.com/Dz5ihd0mqO</a></p>&mdash; Andreas Evers (@andreasevers) <a href="https://twitter.com/andreasevers/status/733559870528442368">May 20, 2016</a></blockquote>

The take away from this keynote is very well tweeted below

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Spring Web Reactive will be in Spring Framework master branch pretty soon <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/springio16?src=hash">#springio16</a> <a href="https://t.co/3nPFm9CFHP">pic.twitter.com/3nPFm9CFHP</a></p>&mdash; Sébastien Deleuze (@sdeleuze) <a href="https://twitter.com/sdeleuze/status/733567517113778178">May 20, 2016</a></blockquote>

I don't like to write documentation, in fact it's an elegant way to say that I hate it. [Andy Wilkinson][andy-wilkinson-springio] convinced me to join his talk because there is light at the end of the tunnel with **TEST-DRIVEN DOCUMENTATION WITH SPRING REST DOCS**.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just about ready for <a href="https://twitter.com/spring_io">@spring_io</a>. I’ll be talking about Spring REST Docs. Losing your swagger can be a good thing <a href="https://t.co/pvhJyjcNoA">pic.twitter.com/pvhJyjcNoA</a></p>&mdash; Andy Wilkinson (@ankinson) <a href="https://twitter.com/ankinson/status/732514550822670336">May 17, 2016</a></blockquote>

I'll definitely check out more of these on [this subject][spring-rest-docs].

After the coffee break it was the perfect time for a session with **40 TIPS & TRICKS FOR SPRING IN INTELLIJ IDEA** given by [Stéphane Nicoll][stéphane-nicoll-springio] and [Yann Cébron][yann-cebron-springio].

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks for attending &quot;40 Tips &amp; Tricks for Spring in IntelliJ IDEA“ u been a great crowd! Sample project: <a href="https://t.co/ExyUo2W1tx">https://t.co/ExyUo2W1tx</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/spring_io">@spring_io</a></p>&mdash; Yann Cébron (@yanncebron) <a href="https://twitter.com/yanncebron/status/733608975149715456">May 20, 2016</a></blockquote>

I don't remember if below inspection in [IntelliJ IDEA][idea-ide] was presented in this talk but I cannot move away without mentioning it.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There&#39;s a new inspection in <a href="https://twitter.com/intellijidea">@intellijidea</a> - I think you&#39;ll like it <a href="https://twitter.com/olivergierke">@olivergierke</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/springio16?src=hash">#springio16</a> <a href="https://t.co/jklIZQ7uDZ">pic.twitter.com/jklIZQ7uDZ</a></p>&mdash; Stéphane Nicoll (@snicoll) <a href="https://twitter.com/snicoll/status/733606491576471556">May 20, 2016</a></blockquote>

The project used in this session waits for you on [github][yann-cebron-springio-project].

Another talk that I liked was **UNDERSTANDING MICROSERVICE PERFORMANCE** given by [Rob Harrop][rob-rarrop-springio].

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The most exciting talk of the day starts: microservices perf by <a href="https://twitter.com/robertharrop">@robertharrop</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/springio16?src=hash">#springio16</a> <a href="https://t.co/ZuTMfYlpwc">pic.twitter.com/ZuTMfYlpwc</a></p>&mdash; Oleg Šelajev (@shelajev) <a href="https://twitter.com/shelajev/status/733607737725161472">May 20, 2016</a></blockquote>

I noted down the following:

* We need to define what we mean by latency.
* [Systems Performance: Enterprise and the Cloud][sysperfbook]
* [Latency Tip Of The Day][latencytipoftheday-most-page-loads]
* [Release It!][release-it-book]

The first talk after lunch was **ANGULAR 2 FOR SPRING DEVELOPERS** given by [Sergi Almar][sergi-almar-twitter] where I found out more about [transpile][transpiler] and [TypeScript][typescriptlang].

One of the last talks was **SPRING INTEGRATION WITH SPRING BOOT AND RABBITMQ** given by [Gary Russell][gary-russell-springio]. My take aways from this talk are to read [Enterprise Integration Patterns][enterprise-integration-patterns-book] and to check [Spring Integration Samples][spring-integration-samples-code].

Two days of attending conference talks can be challenging and my energy level was quite low at that moment. The last two talks I attended were **RAML – SPECIFICATION TO MANAGE THE API LIFECYCLE** and **USING SPRING WITH SCALA** given by FÁTIMA CASAÚ and [Bernhard Wenzel][bernhard-wenzel-springio].

The top three talks of this conference were

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Top three talks of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/springio16?src=hash">#springio16</a> based on attendance by 1) <a href="https://twitter.com/rstoya05">@rstoya05</a> 2) <a href="https://twitter.com/bitboss">@bitboss</a> 3) <a href="https://twitter.com/robertharrop">@robertharrop</a> <a href="https://t.co/sUg5hsffRS">pic.twitter.com/sUg5hsffRS</a></p>&mdash; Spring I/O (@spring_io) <a href="https://twitter.com/spring_io/status/736119114025078784">May 27, 2016</a></blockquote>

and I'm happy that I attended  two of them.

Any respectable event has a slogan and it's the perfect way to end this post. See you next time.
